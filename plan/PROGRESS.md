# PROGRESS — Blueprint Execution Tracker

State for downstream agents. Legend: `[ ]` Todo · `[~]` In Progress · `[x]` Done. Update the line when
you claim/finish a spec. Order = recommended execution order (see [`ROADMAP.md`](ROADMAP.md)). Specs are
in [`specs/`](specs/).

_Baseline at blueprint generation (2026-05-28): 569 tests / 33 suites green; ESLint + Prettier clean;
2 high `npm audit` advisories (axios via localtunnel)._

- [ ] `008` Persistence kill→restart→rejoin integration test — _blocked by: none_
- [ ] `009` Decouple threat detection from ship names; wire seeded names — _blocked by: none_
- [ ] `010` Observability: structured logging + runtime metrics — _blocked by: none_

## Phase 2 — Major Features

- [ ] `019` Horizontal scaling (multi-process/Redis, P7) — _blocked by: 007, 010, 015 (recommended)_

## Completed before this blueprint (context)
The EW1–EW9 easy-win backlog from `docs/ai/FEATURE_PLAN.md` is **done** (combat rating, jettison, port
services, passenger missions, name generator, FLAK+Interceptor, hyperdrive fuel, boarding, mining) —
see `tickets/TICKET006–014` and `docs/LOG.md` iter-0016…0024. Do not re-do these.
